Define an environment variable called SFML_API that points to the SFML sdk/api. It is assumed that the directory structure looks like this:

for the 64 bit version:
$SFML_API/64/bin
$SFML_API/64/lib
$SFML_API/64/...

for the 32 bit version:
$SFML_API/32/bin
$SFML_API/32/lib
$SFML_API/32/...
